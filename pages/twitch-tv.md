descr: Live streaming programming side projects and answering questions / interacting with viewers.

Every Saturday and Sunday morning, 7am - 11am I stream programming to the Science & Technology category on Twitch.tv.  
It's a very casual atmosphere where we generally work on non-monetized projects. I say we, because my viewerbase or "chat" as they are generally refered to is an important part of the development process for these projects, frequently polling them for feature ideas and implementation methods.  
It's important to me that my broadcasts are as entertaining as they are informative, we call this methodology M.D.D. or "Meme driven development".  

#### Some of my favorite highlights

This has been a very fun way to execute on some side projects I've had in mind for a long time. With my twitch affiliation and ability for viewers to subscribe monthly, It's also been a fairly lucrative way to monetize otherwise non-commercial projects.
