desc: Mobile applications to onboard new customers and provide permits to existing customers.


Built in JavaScript / Apache Cordova  
For any user, regardless of customer status it consumes a portion of the docs.permit-data.com api to show latest versions of provision sheet documents.  

This app integrates with an existing WordPress website to allow new customers to sign up and setup billing from within the app. 

Existing customers can access a portion of the app that interfaces with docs.permit-data.com to allow them to pull local copies of permits they have ordered previously. Eliminating the need to faxing or otherwise keeping paper copies to comply with local regulations.
